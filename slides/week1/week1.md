# Format

First 20 minutes will be a lecture on the theme of Modern Chess Players followed by players playing an unrated training-game at a time-control of 20+0 followed by 30 mins analysis of played game(s) and possible tactics/puzzles. All players are expected to notate moves until they have less than 5 minutes.

# Why a New Format
This format encourages participation through weekly game-play, mandatory notation, and collaborative analysis of participant’s own games. These will set players up for entry into tournament play and/or tournament improvement. 

- much of chess learning can now be done online
- advantages of in-person learning is in the analysis
- group discussion of ideas

# Theme

Theme: The theme of this Fall’s lectures are Modern Chess Players including house-hold names such as GM Magnus Carlson, GM Hikaru Nakamura, GM Judit Polgar, rising-stars such as GM Gukesh Dommaraju, GM Hans Niemann, GM Awonder Liang, and top-Canadian players such as GM Shawn-Rogrigue Lemieux and IM Maili Jade Ouellet. The lectures will consist of an introduction of the players, their playing styles, and analysis of a few of their top games. The goal of these lectures is to encourage players to develop a better intuition behind the top-level play in 2025 along with a greater appreciation and discussion on the storylines which will dominate chess circles in the years to come.
